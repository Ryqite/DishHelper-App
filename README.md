# DishHelper-App
This is my Dish helper app, where I can add/change/delete my list of dishes to make the process of containing and finding dishes that I need easier. This app is similar to app "Notes" but for dishes.I was learning the interaction with database. If you are planning to use this app you should change the firebase database to yours.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All work with data was realised by using Firebase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used programs: Android Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used libraries: Firebase Auth, Firebase UI and etc.(check gradle for more information)
